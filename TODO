TODO for my font
================

-- The * character doesn't look good.  It needs to be made larger.

-- Consider tweaking the , character to make it simpler
   (only one angle).  Same goes for ; though this is probably better.

-- The dot in the middle of the 0 character looks really shitty.
   Fix.  Perhaps making the dot squarer will help.
